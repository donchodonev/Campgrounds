# Campgrounds
A Node/Express web app designed to create,remove.upload,destroy and view campgrounds


Creating and updating campgrounds is no longer possible since google require a billing account to be setup for geocoder to work and  error handling doesn't allow a campground to be uploaded without a location being set (lng and lat and location) for it.
